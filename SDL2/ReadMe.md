# SDL2

Simple DirectMedia Layer 2

I regret to inform you that you will NOT find SDL2 here. Only the files that I need myself in order to have all TQSL stuff working, so I can import that all easily. 
You will have to visit the original repositories and sites in order to get the full SDL2 with source codes. Thank you!

SDL2 is not an official part of TQSL, but it's only required to have as a dependency and I hate having to search all the time, that's all.

Oh yeah, all dll files and lib files require 64bit compiling
